# Laboratory of Nuclear and Subnuclear physics 2: electron absorption simulation

The ide behinf this GEANT4 simulatin is to reproduce the behaviour of a muon in iron slabs. Counting the number of electrons that derive from the decayment of the muons in iron and the number of electrons absorbed and not absorbed.
